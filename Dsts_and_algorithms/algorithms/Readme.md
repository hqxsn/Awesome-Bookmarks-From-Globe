#Algorithms

Here you can find useful books for Algorithms.

- #### [Genetic Algorithm Implementation in Python](https://www.aitribune.com/article/2018071087)

  This tutorial will implement the genetic algorithm optimization technique in Python based on a simple example in which we are trying to maximize the output of an equation. The tutorial uses the decimal representation for genes, one point crossover, and uniform mutation.

- #### [JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://github.com/trekhleb/javascript-algorithms/blob/master/README.md)

  This repository contains JavaScript based examples of many popular algorithms and data structures.

  Each algorithm and data structure has its own separate README with related explanations and links for further reading (including ones to YouTube videos).
