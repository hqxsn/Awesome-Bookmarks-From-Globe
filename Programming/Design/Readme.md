  Programmers can be a bit faddish sometimes. Part of why I want to write a book about design is to help be a little more explicit about *why* things should be a certain way. I see too much out there that’s accepted because… well, because. Reasons. It seems cool, everybody’s doing it, “they” said to do things this way, and they’ve got a name for their philosophy and a popular consultancy and everything!
