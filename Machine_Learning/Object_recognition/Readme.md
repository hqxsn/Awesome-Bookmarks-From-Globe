  Object Recognition has recently become one of the most exciting fields in computer vision and AI. The ability of immediately recognizing all the objects in a scene seems to be no longer a secret of evolution. With the development of Convolutional Neural Network architectures, backed by big training data and advanced computing technology, a computer now can surpass human performance in object recognition task under some specific settings, such as face recognition.

  It eventually led to this project, a proof of concept where I got an [Amazon Echo](https://www.amazon.com/echo) to respond to sign language — American Sign Language (ASL) to be more precise, since similar to spoken language there are a variety of sign languages as well.
