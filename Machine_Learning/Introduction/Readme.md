  You’ve probably heard the phrase ‘deep learning’ bandied about in conversation, or maybe you’ve read about it in a post like this one. It seems like almost every tech conversation happening today somehow touches on the topic of AI, machine learning, or deep learning.

  Engineers at Caltech have developed a new control algorithm that enables a single drone to herd an entire flock of birds away from the airspace of an airport. The algorithm is presented in a study in *IEEE Transactions on Robotics*.

  These days having skills in deep learning and machine learning is one of the most trending things in the tech world right now, and businesses are looking to hire developers who possess good knowledge in machine learning.

  Brains receive input from the outside world, their neurons do something to that input, and create an output. That output may be a thought (I want curry for dinner); it may be an action (make curry); it may be a change in mood (yay curry!). Whatever the output, that “something” is a transformation of some form of input (a menu) to output (“chicken dansak, please”). And if we think of a brain as a device that transforms inputs to outputs then, inexorably, the computer becomes our analogy of choice.

- [Robust Implicit Backpropagation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.02433.pdf)

  Arguably the biggest challenge in applying neural networks is tuning the hyperparameters, in particular the learning rate. The sensitivity to the learning rate is due to the reliance on backpropagation to train the network. In this paper we present the first application of Implicit Stochastic Gradient Descent (ISGD) to train neural networks, a method known in convex optimization to be unconditionally stable and robust to the learning rate. Our key contribution is a novel layer-wise approximation of ISGD which makes its updates tractable for neural networks. Experiments show that our method is more robust to high learning rates and generally outperforms standard backpropagation on a variety of tasks.

- [Neural Processes as distributions over functions](http://kasparmartens.rbind.io/post/np/)

  In this year’s ICML, some interesting work was presented on Neural Processes. See the paper [conditional Neural Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.01613) and the follow-up work by the same authors on [Neural Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.01622) which was presented in the workshop.
