- #### ***[GoCD Continuous Delivery on Kubernetes](https://www.gocd.org/2018/03/21/continuous-delivery-gocd-kubernetes/#.W1J57VKDBRo.hackernews)***

  We are excited to announce the [release of our Kubernetes helm chart](https://hub.kubeapps.com/charts/stable/gocd) that will allow our users to run GoCD natively on Kubernetes.

  GoCD is a best-of-breed continuous delivery tool that allows you to model complex continuous delivery workflows. Kubernetes has emerged as one of the most interesting application delivery platforms. Our upcoming releases will have features that allow GoCD users to model Docker based build workflows with deployments to Kubernetes - weâ€™ll cover more about this later in the post.
